        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="aboutContent">Hello! My name is Carolina and I developed this project for Harvard's online course of CS50. 
            I based the project around Studio Ghibli's API, in order to create an online catalog of their released movies, 
            along with a quick description of each one; all of which is generated with API calls and with dynamic content. 
            
            <br> <br>The entire website is built using HTML, CSS and pure Javascript. 

            <br><br>Credits to Tania Rosca and her little project, on which I based the structure of the app, which can be found on her <a href="https://taniarascia.github.io/sandbox/ghibli/">GitHub webpage</a>!
        
            <br><br>This was CS50!
